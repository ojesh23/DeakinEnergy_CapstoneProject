<h2>Hybrid Recommendation</h2>
<h3><i>Combination of Hypothesis-driven and Uncertainity assumption based methods</i></h3>

## Step 1: Understand Incidents and Inspections Datasets 
## Step 2: Generate assumptions based on the previous data
## Step 3: Use hypothesis to accept the assumptions or use EDA to prove that assumptions are valid
## Step 4: Understand the importance of each assumption as some assumption may be more critical for decision making than other assumptions
## Step 5: Assign each assumptions weight
## Step 6: Sum all assumptions values
## Step 7: Generate Postcodes [Higher value means higher priority inspection postcode]
