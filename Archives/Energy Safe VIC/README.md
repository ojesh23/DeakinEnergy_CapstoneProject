## Branches
There are 2 branches in the repository. 
- master 
- developer

master branch is the one that will be live on Azure/hosting platform. No changes should be pushed/committed to master directly.
developer branch is to be used for making any changes. 

When your changes are complete, then create a Pull Request to merge those changes to master branch. Add code/change-set reviewers as appropriate. 
After the Pull request has been accepted by the reviewers, changes will be merged into master and a new deployment can be triggerred to deploy those changes to Azure/hosting platform.

- Switch to developer branch using Source Tree (or a git client of your choice)

## Data Analysis

- The Datasets folder contains the original data provided to us by tutors/staff. Do not make changes there.
- The Data Analysis folder should be used to commit any files related to deliverables e.g. charts, py notebooks, transformed datasets etc.
